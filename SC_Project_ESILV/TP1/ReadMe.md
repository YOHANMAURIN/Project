- What information is available on voters? How do we make sure everyone votes only the number of times allowed?
<br> There is a list with all the voters, if the ith element of the list is a 1 it is a werewolf and if it is 0 it is a villager
At each address we associate a vote, if it has already voted it will not be able to vote again </ br>
